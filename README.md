# Z80 Emulator in Go by AI

This is a Z80 CPU emulator written in Go by AI. Mostly by Qwen-480B.

Currently it pass almost all tests I can found. At now only one from zexall.com are failing. 

## Its joke?
No, its really almost no human intervention except when I tired repeating "look here twice, here is error, focus here!".

I burn about 800 millions tokens for that, so no jokes at all.
